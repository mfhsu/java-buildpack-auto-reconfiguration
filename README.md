# Java Buildpack Auto-Reconfiguration
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/vcap-java.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/vcap-java)

This repository contains the auto-reconfiguration functionality for Spring and Play Framework auto-reconfiguration.  It also contains a replacement Play Framework JPA Plugin that can be properly auto-reconfigured.

## What is Auto-Reconfiguration?
Auto-reconfiguration consists of three parts.  First, it adds the `cloud` profile to Spring's list of active profiles.  Second it exposes all of the properties contributed by Cloud Foundry as a `PropertySource` in the `ApplicationContext`.  Finaly it re-writes the bean defintitions of various types to connect automatically with services bound to the application.  The types that are rewritten are as follows:

| Bean Type | Service Type
| --------- | ------------
| `javax.sql.DataSource` | Relational Data Services (e.g. ClearDB, ElephantSQL)
| `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.ConnectionFactory` | RabbitMQ Service (e.g. CloudAMQP)
| `org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDbFactory` | Mongo Service (e.g. MongoLab)
| `org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisConnectionFactory` | Redis Service (e.g. Redis Cloud)
| `org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.AbstractSessionFactoryBean` | Relational Data Services (e.g. ClearDB, ElephantSQL)
| `org.springframework.orm.hibernate4.LocalSessionFactoryBean` | Relational Data Services (e.g. ClearDB, ElephantSQL)
| `org.springframework.orm.jpa.AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean` | Relational Data Services (e.g. ClearDB, ElephantSQL)
